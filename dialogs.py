"""Native file dialogs and the screenshot writer.

Leaf Windows code: it takes a window handle, shows a system dialog and hands
back a path. Nothing here knows about the pipeline, which is why it could
leave main() - and why the screenshot writer belongs here too rather than
being copied into a test.

Both dialogs are the classic Win32 ones (GetSaveFileNameW,
SHBrowseForFolderW). They block the thread that calls them, so the caller
runs them off the main loop - the overlay must keep drawing while a dialog
is open.
