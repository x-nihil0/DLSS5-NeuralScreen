"""DLSS 5 Desktop NR - the integration skeleton of the prototype.

The loop: desktop capture (capture.ScreenCapture) -> motion guides
(guides.TemporalGuideGenerator) -> the NGX worker (native/nvngx.dll in
--live mode) -> fullscreen output (display.Display).

Controls (global hotkeys, RegisterHotKey + a polling fallback - see
hotkeys.py). Num Lock must be on: the numpad sends Insert/End/arrows
without it:
    Num1          - NR on/off
    Num2          - the settings menu
    Num3          - screenshot
    Num0          - recording
    Num4 / Num6   - processing resolution down / up
    Num5          - process one window instead of the whole screen
    Ctrl+Alt+Q    - quit (the same as "Exit" in the tray)

Every key can be reassigned in the settings menu (config.json
"hotkeys").

Run:
    python main.py [--config config.json]
