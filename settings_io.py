"""What the menu shows, and what the config keeps.

Two directions of one subject. Out: the payload the overlay menu renders -
profiles, presets, sliders, monitors, hotkey captions, the GPU line and
whether neural rendering is really running on it. In: the two things a user
changes through the menu that have to survive a restart - the menu's own
position and size, and the hotkey assignments.

Product defaults live in config.default.json.  The neighbouring config.json is
the user's copy: it is created from those defaults on first launch and migrated
in place when the schema advances.  Both menu save paths keep using the atomic
writer rather than writing over the live file; a crash mid-write used to
truncate the config and lose every setting.

#
# local_tone is half a point lower in every profile than it was through
# 1.8.1 (user, 13.09). The local tone mapping is the part that lifts
# shadows and flattens contrast, and at the old values it was doing more of
# that than the picture wanted - most visibly on dark scenes, where the
# brightening this program does anyway meets it head on. The four sliders
# still reach everything they reached: this moves where the profiles sit,
# not what the range allows.
#
# The profiles no longer carry `profile`, `preset` or `ui_correction`.
# Measured on the 310.8.0 runtime: every value of all three produces a
# byte-identical frame (colour-sweep-20260913, and tests/test_param_effect.py
# reports them every run). They are still sent - the wire layout is shared
# with the resize command and with a hundred tests - but they are sent as a
# fixed zero by the two packers, and nobody has to wonder about them again.
#
# Intensity is clamped at 1.00 inside NVIDIA's DLL, so the 1.65 and 2.50 the
# strong profiles used to ask for were the same picture as 1.00 all along.
# Extreme's local_structure comes down from 2.00 to the new 1.50 ceiling,
# which is the one real change here: measured, that is a detail metric of
# -14.4% against -13.5%, about a percent of the picture.
#
# The auto mask is on in every profile. Measured here on three real frames,
# a frozen input so anything moving between consecutive outputs is the
# network trembling rather than the picture changing:
#
#   source  mask   wiggle  shadows  peak   edges  detail  ms/frame
#   text       0    0.209    0.167    10   1.110   0.965      5.26
#   text       1    0.158    0.131    10   1.096   0.932      5.15
#   film       0    0.363    0.207     9   0.971   0.666      5.26
#   film       1    0.314    0.176     7   0.959   0.669      5.30
#   game       0    0.335    0.304     8   1.225   1.176      5.28
#   game       1    0.308    0.286     6   1.213   1.157      5.26
#
# It damps the trembling by 8-24% and the shadows by 6-22%, takes the peaks
# down (9->7, 8->6), and costs nothing in time - the per-frame figures are
# the same within noise. It is not free: on text it costs 3.4% of the fine
# detail. Text is also where it damps the most, and shimmering text is what
# people report, so that is the trade taken.
#
# The other reason is arithmetic: skin_structure is inert without it. With
# the mask off in two of the four profiles, the fourth slider in the menu
# did nothing at all in those two.
