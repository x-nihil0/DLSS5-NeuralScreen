"""Getting the program ready: from a config file to a running pipeline.

A straight line that runs once, kept away from the loop that runs sixty times
a second. Two halves, in the order they happen:

  configure()  decides what the program is going to do - the config and the
               NR parameters, which monitor, and at what resolution. The
               resolution comes from the REAL monitor rather than from the
               config: a display switched to 1440p while config.json still
               says 4K would leave the overlay, the recording and the worker
               window drifting away from the screen.
  bring_up()   makes it exist - the shared memory, the worker, the overlay,
               the tray icon, the taskbar button, the hotkeys, the guides,
               and every default on the state object the loop then reads.

Order is the whole content of this module. The worker is started before the
overlay because it is the slow part; the menu captions are set only after the
hotkeys are registered, because before that there are no bindings to name;
and the state defaults come last, so nothing the loop reads is missing when
the first frame arrives.

# --- Log to a file instead of the console --------------------------------

# NeuralScreen.log next to main.py - every print keeps working and the user
# reads the log as a file rather than a window. Startup errors (a missing DLL
# and the like) are additionally shown in a message box (see the bottom of
# this file).

# four diagnostic packages of 19.09: 499 of 916 lines (raycornea), 477 of 966
# (saymoin), 145 of 243 (codemned), 111 of 220 (saymoin), 76 of 153 (manik).
# That is exactly the half a report needs: "the menu opened 21 times" cannot be
# placed against "the user minimised a window" when neither line carries a
# time, and a z-order decision could only be dated by its neighbouring line.
# The [z] lines and the menu open/close lines are both in that untimed half.

# the stamp is put on when the line is written rather than when it was queued.
